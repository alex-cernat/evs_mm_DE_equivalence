# Investigating the impact of mode design on measurement quality

Using an experiment in the European Value Study Germany we do the following comparisons:
- compare single- vs. mixed-mode designs (full length FTF vs. full length mixed-mode)
- compare short vs. long questionnaire (matrix vs. full length)

--Mail vs. mail
--Web vs. web
--Web-mail vs. web-mail

# To do

- [x] set-up GitHub (Alex)
- [x] provide data (Tobias/Pablo)
- [x] alternative quality indicators (Tobias/Pablo)
- [ ] check scales fit and choose for invariance (Alex)
- [ ] do invariance testing (Alex)
- [ ] write intro and lit review (Joe)
- [ ] write data section (Tobias/Pablo)
- [ ] write methods quality indicators (Tobias/Pablo)
- [ ] write methods invariance (Alex)
- [ ] write up results (Joe)
- [ ] write conclusions (Joe)



# To discuss

- results from Pablo and Tobias
- scales with 0 in the excel
- what scales to use
